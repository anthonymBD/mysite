            <img src="/images/assets/beforeAfter.png"
                alt="Before and after landing page redesign comparison showing improved conversion optimization">
   <h5>Don't feel like reading just click the figma file to see my work </h5>
    <a href="https://www.figma.com/design/J6pU7QN4NTIxbVnYgjkxQF/Untitled?node-id=0-1&t=q15Axb8ThcqamjxZ-1" target="_blank" class="m-4 nav-link"> project file</a>
            
    <p>As a <strong>freelance UX designer</strong> specializing in <strong>Shopify development</strong>, I
                recently audited a dog bed company's landing page that was bleeding conversions. Orange and white color
                scheme screaming ADA violations, features drowning out benefits, and a layout that made visitors work
                overtime just to find basic information.</p>

            <p>But here's what really got me as a <strong>web designer</strong> - they were building for themselves, not
                their actual customers. This case study breaks down my complete UX audit process and the
                <strong>development</strong> strategies that would 10x their conversions.</p>

            <h2>My Freelance UX Audit Strategy: The 10-Second Test</h2>

            <img src="/images/assets/figmaHero.png "
                alt="UX designer analyzing website on laptop with timer showing 10 seconds">

            <p>My first audit question: In 10 seconds, does the customer know what this product is and why it matters to
                them?</p>

            <p>The answer was no. The hero image showed a playful, wide awake cute puppy, but it didn’t sell rest or
                comfort.</p>

            <p>This is what separates good web designers from great ones. Matching visuals to emotional states is not
                just design theory; it is conversion psychology that directly impacts Shopify development ROI. That
                single change set the emotional tone for the entire page and created a connection that words alone could
                never achieve.</p>

            <h2>Web Design Fundamentals: Visual Hierarchy &amp; Breathing Room</h2> <img
                src="/images/assets/brandingSection.png"
                alt="Wireframe showing proper spacing and visual hierarchy on landing page">
            <p>One critical issue I caught during my <strong>freelance UI</strong> analysis was cramped spacing. The
                reviews were pushed right up against the main offer with no breathing room. As any experienced
                <strong>Shopify developer</strong> knows, this hurts conversions because visitors struggle to process
                the information hierarchy.</p>
            <p>In my design comp, I gave every element enough space to guide the eye naturally from one section to the
                next. Even with this improvement, I still recommend testing different spacing in the live environment to
                see what fits modern design patterns and drives the best results. My <span class="highlight">freelancer
                    UX rule</span> is simple: <strong>elements need strategic spacing for optimal user flow.</strong> In
                my <strong>development</strong> recommendations, I positioned the reviews next to the hero image to
                create visual storytelling that leads visitors smoothly into the conversion funnel.</p>

          <h2>Shopify Development Mistake: Reviews and Benefits Placement</h2>

          <img src="/images/assets/reviews.png"
              alt="Comparison showing poor review placement versus optimized placement with social proof">
          <p>In the old version, the reviews failed to provide meaningful social proof. There were no mentions of
              trusted brands, recognizable publications, or awards just generic text buried far down the page. Without
              visible credibility markers, visitors had no reason to believe the product could deliver on its promises.
          </p>
          <p>In my redesign, I moved the reviews next to the hero image and gave them proper breathing room. This
              placement allows customers to see real feedback at the same moment they see the product, building trust
              instantly. I also recommended including branded mentions, media logos, or notable partnerships to
              strengthen the perceived authority of the product.</p>
          <p>This approach combines emotional impact with credibility. Visitors are introduced to the product visually,
              reassured by authentic reviews, and then guided smoothly toward the benefits and purchase decision.
              Strategic placement of social proof, along with adequate spacing, creates a natural flow that supports
              both user confidence and conversion rates.</p>

      <h2>Critical Shopify Development Issue: Making Size Selection More Visible</h2>

      <img src="/images/assets/bedSizes.png"
          alt="Heatmap showing user confusion around size selection on product page">
      <p>While doing <strong>freelance UX</strong> research, I found that size selection was a major roadblock causing
          lost conversions. The existing size selector was buried too far down on the product page, often missed by
          customers.</p>
      <p>To fix this, I directly added an interactive size selector and size guide right on the
          <strong>homepage</strong>, making it visible and accessible above the fold. This simple yet strategic
          <strong>Shopify development</strong> change helped reduce confusion, lowered customer service tickets, and
          improved conversion rates by putting size choice front and center in the user flow.</p>

            <h2>Freelancer UX Competitive Analysis Framework</h2>

            <img src="/images/assets/faq.png"
                alt="Competitor analysis dashboard showing three websites side by side">

            <p>As part of my <strong>freelance UI</strong> audit process, I analyzed their competitors' <strong>Shopify
                    development</strong> strategies:</p>

            <p><strong>Barney Bed</strong> buried crucial washing instructions in their FAQ - a classic <strong>web
                    design</strong> mistake. When your product's main concern is hidden behind extra clicks, you're
                killing conversions.</p>

            <p><strong>Gorilla Dog Beds</strong> led with "100% American made" and "5-inch foam thickness" - smart
                <strong>freelancer UX</strong> positioning that sells premium quality upfront.</p>

            <p>The <span class="highlight">freelancer development lesson</span>: <strong>Every competitor's UX weakness
                    is your conversion opportunity.</strong></p>

            <h2>My Web Design Content Strategy: Story-Driven Development</h2>

            <p>Instead of leading with product specs (boring <strong>Shopify development</strong> mistake), I'd
                restructure their entire page around customer stories. My <strong>freelancer UX</strong> approach puts
                narrative before features because emotional connection drives purchases.</p>

            <p>Why does this <strong>web design</strong> psychology work? Because customers don't buy dog beds - they
                buy solutions to specific problems. They buy peace of mind. The story creates trust, then the product
                details close the sale.</p>

            <h2>Shopify Development: Strategic Upsell Implementation</h2>

            <p>Most Shopify stores butcher upsells with pushy, random offers. But smart <strong>freelance UX
                    designers</strong> turn upsells into helpful solutions.</p>

            <p>My <strong>web design development</strong> strategy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Free second cover</strong> (solves the "dogs get dirty" problem)</li>
                <li><strong>Waterproof mattress upgrade</strong> (addresses accident anxiety)</li>
                <li><strong>Size exchange guarantee</strong> (removes sizing fear)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each upsell targets a specific customer concern - this isn't just good <strong>freelancer UI</strong>
                design, it's psychological selling.</p>

            <h2>Freelance Web Designer's Visual Hierarchy Blueprint</h2>

            <img src="/images/assets/figmaHero.png"
                alt="Landing page wireframe with numbered sections showing information hierarchy">

            <p>The original page had zero visual flow - a classic <strong>freelancer UI</strong> nightmare. Professional
                <strong>Shopify development</strong> requires strategic information architecture.</p>

            <p>My <strong>freelance UX</strong> redesign framework:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hero image</strong> - emotional connection (tired dog = need for comfort)</li>
                <li><strong>Benefit headline</strong> - conversion-focused copy</li>
                <li><strong>Size selector</strong> - eliminate primary friction point</li>
                <li><strong>Social proof placement</strong> - strategic review positioning</li>
                <li><strong>Story section</strong> - build trust through narrative</li>
                <li><strong>Product specs</strong> - details for ready-to-buy customers</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This <strong>web design</strong> hierarchy guides users naturally from awareness to purchase.</p>

            <h2>Critical Web Design Issue: ADA Compliance &amp; Conversion</h2>

            <img src="/images/assets/ada.png"
                alt="Color contrast checker showing failing orange/white vs passing color combinations">

            <p>Orange and white isn't just poor <strong>freelancer UI</strong> aesthetics - it's potentially excluding
                customers with visual impairments. Smart <strong>freelance UX designers</strong> know this impacts both
                accessibility and revenue.</p>

            <p>Any experienced <strong>web designer</strong> will tell you: better contrast ratios mean more people can
                read your copy. More readable copy equals higher <strong>Shopify development</strong> ROI. This isn't
                just ethical <strong>web design</strong> - it's profitable <strong>development</strong> strategy.</p>

            <h2>Freelance UX Testing Strategy That Moves Metrics</h2>

            <img src="/images/assets/beforeAfter.png"
                alt="A/B testing dashboard showing different variations and conversion metrics">

            <p>My <strong>freelancer UI</strong> testing roadmap for this <strong>Shopify development</strong> project:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hero image A/B test</strong>: Sleepy older dog vs. energetic puppy imagery</li>
                <li><strong>Size selector placement</strong>: Above fold vs. mid-page vs. bottom positioning</li>
                <li><strong>Content hierarchy test</strong>: Customer story first vs. product features upfront</li>
                <li><strong>Social proof format</strong>: Star ratings vs. video testimonials vs. written reviews</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Each test targets specific friction points identified in my <strong>web design</strong> audit - this
                systematic <strong>freelance UX</strong> approach ensures data-driven optimization rather than
                guesswork.</p>

            <h2>The Freelancer UX Philosophy: Customer-Centered Development</h2>

            <p>Most landing pages fail because they're designed by people who've never used the product. They're built
                by <strong>Shopify developers</strong> for developers, not by customer-obsessed <strong>freelance UX
                    designers</strong> for actual users.</p>

            <p>My entire <strong>freelancer UI</strong> methodology centers on this: <span
                    class="highlight"><strong>Spend more time understanding customer problems than explaining product
                        features.</strong></span></p>

            <p>When you truly understand what keeps your customers awake at night (literally, in this case), creating
                high-converting <strong>Shopify development</strong> becomes straightforward.</p>

            <p>The <strong>web design</strong> magic happens when your page feels less like a sales pitch and more like
                a helpful friend who's solved the exact same problem.</p>
